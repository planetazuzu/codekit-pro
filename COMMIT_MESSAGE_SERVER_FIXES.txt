fix(server): improve error handling and prevent 500 errors

Improve error handling in storage layer and API routes to prevent 500 errors
when database is unavailable or queries fail:

- Storage fallback: Use MemStorage if PostgreSQL fails or not initialized
- Graceful degradation: Return empty arrays/null instead of throwing errors
- Stats endpoint: Return default stats (0,0,0,0) instead of 500 on error
- Enhanced health checks: Verify database connection in /health endpoint
- Improved deployment service: Better retry logic and health checks

This ensures the frontend always receives valid responses even when the
backend has issues, preventing crashes and infinite error loops.

FILES CHANGED:
- server/storage/index.ts (fallback to MemStorage, error handling)
- server/routes/stats.ts (return default stats on error)
- server/routes/webhooks.ts (improved retry logic)
- server/services/deployment.service.ts (enhanced health checks)
- server/index.ts (enhanced /health endpoint with DB check)
