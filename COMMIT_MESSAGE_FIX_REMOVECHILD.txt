fix(mobile): eliminate removeChild errors by maintaining stable React tree structure

PROBLEM:
- removeChild errors occurring only on mobile devices
- React Error #31 and #185 causing infinite error loops
- Service Worker auto-reloads triggering DOM inconsistencies
- Conditional component rendering based on viewport changing React tree

ROOT CAUSE:
- page-router.tsx was using conditional rendering: isMobile ? MobilePage : DesktopPage
- This changed the React tree structure based on viewport size
- React's reconciliation algorithm expects stable tree structure
- Tree changes during render caused DOM inconsistencies (removeChild errors)

SOLUTION:
- Refactored page-router.tsx to always render both MobilePage and DesktopPage
- CSS (Tailwind classes) now controls visibility instead of conditional rendering
- Updated MobileOnly and DesktopOnly components to use CSS pattern
- Disabled Service Worker by default to prevent auto-reload issues
- Added comprehensive anti-regression comments throughout codebase

CHANGES:
- refactor(page-router): use CSS-based responsive pattern instead of conditional rendering
- refactor(mobile): MobileOnly/DesktopOnly now use CSS visibility
- fix(main): disable Service Worker by default (can be re-enabled with VITE_ENABLE_SW=true)
- docs: add anti-regression warnings to prevent future issues
- refactor(mobile-lazy): mark conditional lazy loading as deprecated

FILES CHANGED:
- client/src/utils/page-router.tsx
- client/src/components/mobile/MobileOnly.tsx
- client/src/components/mobile/DesktopOnly.tsx
- client/src/utils/mobile-lazy.tsx
- client/src/main.tsx
- client/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx
- client/src/layout/Layout.tsx
- client/src/App.tsx
- server/storage/index.ts
- server/routes/stats.ts

TESTING:
- ✅ Desktop: Works correctly
- ✅ Mobile: No more removeChild errors
- ✅ Resize: Smooth transitions without errors
- ✅ Reload: Stable rendering
- ✅ ErrorBoundary: No infinite loops

ANTI-REGRESSION:
- Added comprehensive comments explaining WHY CSS pattern is required
- Documented forbidden patterns that cause removeChild errors
- Marked deprecated utilities with warnings
