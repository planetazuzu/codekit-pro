fix(error-handling): improve error recovery and prevent infinite loops

Improve error handling to prevent infinite error loops and improve recovery:

- Global reload state: Use sessionStorage to track reload attempts globally
- Cooldown mechanism: 5-second cooldown between reload attempts
- ErrorBoundary improvements: Stop rendering immediately when reloading
- RemoveChild error suppression: Ignore DOM errors during recovery
- Environment variable fallbacks: Better handling of undefined env vars

This prevents the infinite error loops that were occurring when React
errors triggered automatic reloads.

FILES CHANGED:
- client/src/lib/chunk-error-handler.ts (global reload state, cooldown)
- client/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx (immediate render halt)
- client/src/lib/constants.ts (API_BASE_URL fallback)
