feat(tools): add Code Cleaner and Dependency Analyzer tools

Add two new developer tools to help with code quality:

- Code Cleaner: Analyzes code to find unused imports, dead code, and duplications
- Dependency Analyzer: Analyzes package.json to detect unused and outdated dependencies

Both tools provide:
- Detailed analysis with categorized issues
- Actionable suggestions for improvements
- Clean code generation (remove unused imports, etc.)
- Export functionality (copy/download)

FILES CHANGED:
- client/src/tools/CodeCleaner.tsx (new)
- client/src/tools/DependencyAnalyzer.tsx (new)
- client/src/pages/Tools.tsx (registered new tools)
- client/src/pages/mobile/Tools.tsx (registered new tools)
- client/src/hooks/use-search.ts (added to search index)
- client/src/App.tsx (routes and lazy imports)
